The former FBI Director James Comey has a book coming in 2018.

FOX's Michelle Pollino reports:

James Comey, the former FBI Director who was fired in May while investigating the Trump-Russia allegations has a book deal with Flatiron Books.

Comey will write about everything from allegations of ties between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign to the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. The untitled book is currently scheduled for publication next spring.

Mr. Trump fired Comey in May, telling NBC that he was bothered by Comey's inability to put to rest the Russia investigation which he called a "fake story."
