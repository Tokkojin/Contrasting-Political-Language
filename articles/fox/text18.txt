Republicans plan to do it alone on a tax reform push this year.

FOX's Jared Halpern has more from Capitol Hill:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says don't expect a 1986-style tax reform bill when leaders from both parties helped rewrite the tax code:

(McConnell) "Most of the principles that would get the country growing again, they're not interested in addressing."

McConnell responding to a letter for a majority of Senate Democrats, calling for bipartisan negotiations, but making clear they won't support any plan that includes tax cuts for the top one percent of income earners.

Budget reconciliation rules allow just simple majorities in the Senate, preventing filibusters.
