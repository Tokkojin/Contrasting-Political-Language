Donald Trump's ascension to the Presidency of the United States was one of the most surprising political storylines in the last century. According to Guy Benson, much of his victory had to do with Americans being fed up with political correctness.

During The Tom Shillue Show on Wednesday, Tom was joined by Fox News contributor and Political Editor of Townhall.com, Guy Benson. Guy talked to Tom about the re-release the book he co-authored with Mary Katharine Ham, titled, End of Discussion: How the Left's Outrage Industry Shuts Down Debate, Manipulates Voters, and Makes America Less Free (and Fun).

The book initially came out in 2015, but Guy and Mary wanted to add to it following Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 Presidential Election. Guy discussed how many right-of-center Americans were tired of people on the left grinding them into dust culturally. People on the right realized that, although Trump had has flaws, he was not afraid to fight back against the attacks from Democrats.

Guy talked about how Trump tapped into the anger and frustration with both parties in a way that Hillary Clinton did not. Despite the media constantly doubting him and saying he had no chance, he was still able to win the election. Guy and Tom agreed that political correctness was the overwhelming reason why Trump was able to accomplish this seemingly impossible feat.
