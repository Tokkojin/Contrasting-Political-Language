In a letter to the head of ABC News, a U.S. senator criticizes the news organization for carelessly editorializing by using the term "hate group" in a report about a prominent Christian legal organization. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., suggests to ABC News President James Goldston that an account by two of his reporters in fact unfairly maligned a "peaceful group," whose recent conference was the venue for a speech on religious freedom by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In his letter, dated Monday, Lankford asks Goldston: "Why would ABC News label a peaceful group as a 'hate group' simply because of a difference of opinion?" The July 12 report by ABC News' Pete Madden and Erin Galloway was about Sessions' speech to Alliance Defending Freedom at its gathering in Orange County, California. Senator James Lankford (R-OK) joined the Todd Starnes Show today to discuss why he chose to defend AFD. Listen to the full interview below:
