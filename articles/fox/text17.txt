President Trump putting support behind a bill that if passed is expected to drastically limit immigration.

FOX's Jon Decker reports from the White House:

President Trump threw his support behind a bill that would dramatically cut legal immigration into the U.S. by 50 percent over the next 10 years. The bill, which has stalled for months in the Senate, would eliminate diversity lottery visas and limit the number of refugees offered permanent residency in the country each year:

(President Trump) "This competitive application process will favor applicants who can speak English, financially support themselves and their families."

Limiting legal immigration is opposed by business groups, which rely on low-skilled workers for agriculture jobs.
