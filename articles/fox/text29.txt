Lowering the bar, for the bar.

FOX's Rich Denison explains:

Attorneys who want to practice in California might be getting a break. The state bar, facing a dramatic decline in people passing California's licensing exam, are considering a plan to lower the minimum score needed for passage on the most recent test administered last week.

While the proposal only drops the minimum score by three points, it would significantly increase the pass rate. California is considered to have one of the toughest bar exams in the country. The state's Supreme Court would have the final say on the proposal.
