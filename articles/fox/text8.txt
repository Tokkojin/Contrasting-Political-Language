The Trump administration is telling Senators it has all the authority it needs to continue operations against ISIS.

FOX's Jared Halpern has more from Capitol Hill:

The State Department argues the Trump administration does not need new authority to continue its campaign against ISIS in Syria.

A letter written in response to Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, says a 2001 authorization for the use of military force, provides necessary authority to support counter ISIS operations.

There has been a bipartisan push by some in Congress to repeal the 2001 authorization approved after the 9/11 attacks and draft a new war powers resolution.
