Could the amount of sleep you are getting have an impact on your weight?

FOX's Alex Hein explains a new study in this "Housecall for Health":

This is Housecall for Health.

So, not only could skimping on your sleep hurt your mental health or give you bags under your eyes, but it could also add some pounds to your waistline.

This new study, which followed 1600 adults who self reported sleeping habits, found that those who got an average of six hours of shuteye had a waist circumference three centimeters larger than those who slept for nine hours a night.

Those who were skimping on sleep also had higher BMI and lower good-cholesterol levels.

There was a group who fell in between six and nine hours, with participants getting an average of 7.5 hours of shuteye. Those adults still fared better than those who were only getting six hours.

Researchers emphasized that they didn't find a link between less sleep and poorer diets, nor did they prove a direct explanation as to whether less sleep caused you to gain weight or was the result of weight gain.
