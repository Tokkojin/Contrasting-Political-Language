A Pennsylvania man is behind bars after he was unhappy with his fast food meal.

FOX's Anna Eliopoulos reports:

"Where's the beef?"

That's not what Theodore Gunderson Jr. was asking when he ordered a salad at a New Holland Wendy's Sunday. In his eyes, his order didn't have enough cucumbers. He threw the salad at an employee, and issued a death threat, saying, "If I had a gun or knife you would be the first to go."

Gunderson then locked himself in his car with police eventually getting him to roll down his window. And after they told him he was under arrest, he began to turn on the car, causing an officer to reach inside and try to grab the keys.

Eventually, Gunderson was able to drive off, with the cop having to take a few steps to avoid falling under the vehicle. Gunderson was eventually stopped and arrested.
