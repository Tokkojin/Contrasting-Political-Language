There's new data on the death rate for older workers.

FOX's Paul Stevens reports:

Older people are dying on the job at a higher rate than workers overall, even as the rate of workplace fatalities decreases, that's according to a new AP analysis of federal statistics.

About 35 percent of the fatal workplace accidents in 2015 involved a worker 55 and older. One expert saying that physical changes associated with getting old could potentially make a workplace injury more serious or possibly fatal.

Gerontologists saying those changes include gradually worsening vision and hearing, reduced response time, balance issues and chronic problems like arthritis.
