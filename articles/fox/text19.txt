During The Tom Shillue Show on Tuesday, prominent actor/producer/director Bruce Campbell called up Tom to discuss his career, as well as his upcoming book, Hail to the Chin: Further Confessions of a B Movie Actor.

Bruce discussed his career, which has been highlighted by his performance as Ash Williams in Sam Raimi's Evil Dead franchise. Tom asked Bruce about his relationship with Raimi, and how he ended up working with him on multiple projects. The two actually met in middle school and became very good friends. Bruce went on to appear in many of Sam's movies, including the Spider-Man trilogy that he directed.

Bruce recounted the story of how one of the most famous horror writers of all-time helped give his career a boost early on. Right before The Evil Dead came out, the movie got an endorsement from none other than Stephen King.

Tom also asked Bruce how he would go about making movies today if he and Sam were just getting started. Bruce said that it is so much easier to create your own films nowadays because the technology is much more advanced and readily available.
