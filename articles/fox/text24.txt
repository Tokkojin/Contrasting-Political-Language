President Trump defended his habit of going on Twitter on Tuesday, saying it's the "only way for me to get the truth out!"

"Only the Fake News Media and Trump enemies want me to stop using Social Media (110 million people). Only way for me to get the truth out!," he wrote on Twitter.

The president has used the social messaging site to attack his critics, tout his agenda andâ€‹ praise his supporters, but he has also been heavily criticized for doing so.
