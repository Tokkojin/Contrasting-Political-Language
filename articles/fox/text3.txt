An NBA legend getting in on the all-time great debate.

FOX's Matt Napolitano reports:

The question given to Michael Jordan at his basketball camp in Santa Barbara, California was who is the better player all-time? Kobe Bryant or LeBron James?

M.J. drawing some applause and some gasps, naming Kobe the better player... Why?

(Jordan) "There's something about five that beats three... Kobe won five championships."

Jordan alluding to Kobe Bryant having won five NBA titles to LeBron's three.

The "count the rings" argument is a steadfast one for the Bulls great as he proclaimed Kobe better than LeBron in a 2013 interview. At that point, LeBron only had one ring.
