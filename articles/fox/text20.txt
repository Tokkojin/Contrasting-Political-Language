President Trump's pick for FBI Director has been confirmed by the Senate.

FOX's Jared Halpern reports from Capitol Hill:

Christopher Wray enjoyed bipartisan support and accolades after promising to keep the FBI independent and free from politics.

The 92 to 5 confirmation vote follows unanimous support in the Senate Judiciary Committee and high marks from the committee's top Democrat Diane Feinstein:

(Feinstein) "Mr. Wray has committed to supporting and protecting the investigation being conducted by Special Counsel Mueller."

Wray will replace James Comey who was fired by President Trump in May. Comey told Congress he believes he was dismissed because of the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election.

President Trump is getting a new director of the FBI after the Senate confirmed his choice of Christopher Wray to take over the bureau on Tuesday.

The Senate voted 92 to 5 to approve Wray's nomination.

Trump announced his selection of Wray to lead the FBI in early July after abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in May.

Comey was fired by the president amid tensions over the Russia investigation. During his confirmation hearing, Wray testified that he'd conduct his job "without regard to any partisan political influence."

"I believe to my core that there's only one right way to do this job," Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "And that is with strict independence. By the book. Playing it straight. Faithful to the Constitution."
