J.K. Rowling apologizes for remarks concerning the President.

FOX's Michelle Pollino reports:

J.K. Rowling has apologized for tweets she posted concerning the President and a disabled boy. Rowling always quick to criticize the President called Mr. Trump "horrible" after seeing footage of the President appearing to ignore the child's outstretched hand during a White House event last week.

However, the boys mom corrected the 'Harry Potter' author on Facebook, writing, "the President didn't snub her son and the boy wasn't even trying to shake Mr. Trump's hand."

Rowling wrote that she apologize unreservedly. And she very clearly projected her own "sensitivities around the issue" onto the images that she saw. Rowling deleted her original tweets.
