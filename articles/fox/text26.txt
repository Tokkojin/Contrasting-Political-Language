A Maryland police officer's viral act of kindness for a mother caught stealing.

FOX's Krystin Goodwin has the story:

Laurel police officer Bennett Johns responded to a shoplifting call at a grocery store. Officers say a 20-year-old mother tried to steal two packs of diapers for her infant son. She had run out of money after buying groceries and didn't have the extra $15. While the unidentified mother was given a citation for shoplifting, Officer Johns paid for the diapers out of his own pocket so the "young child didn't have to suffer."

In a statement on Facebook the department thanked Officer Johns "not for just fairly enforcing the law, but also showing empathy to an innocent child put in a difficult situation."

Thousands are reacting and applauding the officer for his "compassion." The department added the young mother will receive support from social services.
