An Ohio man charged with hiding his girlfriend's body in a freezer and living with another woman in her home.

FOX's Lilian Woo reports:

Authorities in Ohio say a man stored his girlfriend's body in a freezer with the help of another woman who then assumed the identity of the dead girlfriend, moving into Shannon Graves' home, using her credit cards, even caring for her dog.

The two Katrina Layton and Arturo Novoa arrested and charged with corpse abuse after the body was discovered in the home near Youngstown.

Investigators say Novoa asked a friend to keep a padlocked freezer, but that friend became suspicious, managed to open it and then called police.

Graves's family which had filed a missing persons report, says the 28-year-old last seen in February, never left home without her car, dog and phone, and all three remained behind.
