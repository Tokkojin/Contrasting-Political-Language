(CNN) There were tears, laughter and quips on Wednesday as the cast of mid-2000s drama "Everwood" reunited to promote the show's continued life on the CW's streaming service, CW Seed.

The series, which ran on the WB network form 2002-06, began streaming there last month.

The WB became the CW in 2006 after it merged with UPN.

"Everwood" was a casualty of the new network's formation, and the cast laughed when it was pointed out that it was the CW, presenting its new and existing programs as part of the Television Critics Association press tour, that brought them all back together.
