Many who arrived to the stadium on Wednesday are Haitians, according to CNN's partners, CTV and CBC. They came off shuttle buses holding their children and their belongings, as they got in line to enter the building.

In recent months, a soaring number of people have crossed to Canada from the US. Many have expressed concerns that they'll be deported under President Donald Trump's policies.

Amid the increasing influx to Canada, shelters in Montreal are full so the Olympic Stadium is being used, reported CTV.

The stadium, which had been built to host the 1976 Summer Olympics, had more than a hundred green cots along with blankets and metal dividers set up inside its massive, concrete halls.
