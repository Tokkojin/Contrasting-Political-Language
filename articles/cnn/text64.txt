Google is bringing a bit of magic to your Android device.

The company announced new apps and features for its products to coincide with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The film prequel to the Harry Potter series opens in theaters November 18.

OK Google, the voice activated assistant for Android, casts Harry Potter "spells." Using the commands "lumos" and "nox" turn the flashlight on and off, and "Silencio" silences notifications and the ringer.

You can interact with the world of Fantastic Beasts on Google Street View. A virtual reality app for Google's Daydream View lets you wave a wand to find escaped magical creatures. Google announced the wizarding VR feature in October when it launched the Daydream View. The device goes on sale this month.
