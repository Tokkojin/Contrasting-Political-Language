Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump boasted about his election victory, pressured his Mexican counterpart to remain quiet about a border wall and called New Hampshire a "drug-infested den" in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pe単a Nieto, according to a transcript of the conversation revealed on Thursday by The Washington Post.

The January 27 phone call with Pe単a Nieto came seven days after Trump entered office. In it, he focused mainly on issues of trade and immigration, with contentious moments coming in his insistence that Mexico will eventually pay for a wall along with US southern border. Pe単a Nieto has insisted publicly his country will not pay for the wall's construction, but Trump demanded he cease making that claim."

"You cannot say that to the press," Trump said on the phone call. "The press is going to go with that and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances."

In their conversation, Trump said he was willing to say publicly that he and Mexican authorities would continue to negotiate over the wall's payment, which he said "means it will come out in the wash and that is OK."

But he maintained his insistence that Pe単a Nieto remain quiet about the issue.
