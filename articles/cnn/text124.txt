Story highlights Duties include ensuring humans don't contaminate space

Officer also must make sure other organisms don't contaminate Earth either

(CNN) NASA wants you to be its real-life guardian of the planet.

The space agency is looking for a planetary protection officer, someone to guard the planet from "organic-constituent and biological contamination in human and robotic space exploration."

In other words, the officer's responsibilities include ensuring humans don't contaminate space, and other organisms don't contaminate Earth either.

Doing so will maintain worlds in their natural states and avoid contaminating explored environments, NASA says.
