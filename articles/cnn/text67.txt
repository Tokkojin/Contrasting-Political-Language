Virtual Reality Viewers: Best for Families with Young Kids

Virtual reality viewers are inexpensive, handheld devices that offer three-dimensional views and the feeling of being in a different place. The viewers' lenses work by extending the depth of static images or animation but do not allow you to interact with your environment. To use them, download any app labeled "VR" in either iTunes or Google Play, launch the app, and insert your smartphone into the viewer. Most viewers use your phone's button or another basic input to control the action.

Key features

• Inexpensive

• Compatible with most smartphones and iOS or Android apps labeled "VR" (except for the View-Master, which uses specially designed apps)

• More like a 3D movie than true VR

• Best for educational content and games

VR Headsets: Best for Big Kids and Tweens

Moving up in price and features are VR headsets. They're similar to viewers in that you download VR apps from the app store and insert your phone in them. Headsets work with the exact same apps as the viewers (except for the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream Viewbut give you a more immersive experience.

The advantages of headsets are that they're more comfortable to wear for a longer time, they fit better (preventing light leaks), they have better lenses, and they often have earphone ports. That's why some people like to use them to view videos. They don't make the videos three-dimensional, but they provide a personal-movie-theater-type experience. They also typically have built-in game controllers on the headset itself or work with handheld controllers, giving you more options in apps than you would have with a simple viewer.

Key features

• Pricier than viewers

• Compatible with most smartphones (except the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View) and iOS or Android apps labeled "VR"

• More believable, you-are-there experience, but limited ability to interact with your environment

• Headsets have minimum age requirements set by the manufacturers; check the age before you buy.
